You’ve become someone I look forward to seeing, someone who makes my days brighter, and I find myself \nthinking about you more than I’d like to admit. There’s just something about your energy, your smile, and the way you make \neverything feel more meaningful. I really care about you. I admire so much about you, from the way you carry yourself to how \nkind and thoughtful you are to others. I’m not asking for anything to change right away, but if you’re open to it, I’d love to\nsee where this could go between us. I just thought it was time to be honest and put it out there, no matter what. Thanks for \nlistening, and I hope we can continue being close, no matter what happens.");
